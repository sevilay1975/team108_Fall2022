        Maximum Possible Value

        Create a program that will print the maximum possible value of the given number N by inserting the digit '5' somewhere in the integer.

        > bounds of N: -8,000 - 8,000

        Ex:
            Given N = 268, the program should return 5268
            Given N = 670, the program should return 6750
            Given N = 0, the program should return 50
            Given N = -999, the program should return -5999

            test values: 268, 670, 678, 839, -999, -490, -400
